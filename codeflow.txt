just jotting down some ideas for how the code shoudl operate

- pass in the user options
- initalize
  - get the current wavelength and use this as the set point
  - get the current resonator voltage and convert to control
  - set the resonator to this (imperfectly matched) control value
  - initalize the PID
- main loop
  - get the current wavemeter value
  - feed this to the pid function returning a resonator value
  - set the resonator to this value
  
  - auto align
    - IF the last time it was aligned was a long time ago
	- OR the set point has moved a lot from the last time it was aligned
	- AND the error is small enough
      - turn on align
      -
